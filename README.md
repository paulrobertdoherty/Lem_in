# Lem_in
My progress for the 42 project Lem_in

It will use Dijkstra's algorithm to simulate ants trying to find their way across an ant farm.
Right now, I'm working on the algorithm, error handling, and optimization using hash tables.
If you find any errors or places to improve it, please let me know. I'll really appreciate it.
