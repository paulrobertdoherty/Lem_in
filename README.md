# Lem_in
This is my code for the 42 project [Lem_in](https://cdn.intra.42.fr/pdf/pdf/947/lem-in.en.pdf) (using the March 2019 PDF). Thank you to [Jamie Dawson](https://github.com/JamieDawson) for being my project partner and helping me write it.

It uses an [Edmonds Karp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonds%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm) interpretation to find the best paths to send the ants, as well as another algorithm to find the best order to send the ants.

While the project is quite fast, there exist a few ways to improve the speed of the project, such as to perhaps use an adjacency list instead of an adjacency matrix as well as to use hashmaps where appropriate.

There also exists a visualizer that allows for the creation of an image to represent the map. Run run.sh according to README in the file to use it.
