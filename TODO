Add an actual path algorithm
	Breadth-first Dijkstra, whatever that means
~~~~~~~~Once I'm Done Debugging~~~
Error handling
	Depends on what counts as an error as well
~~~~~~~~Things to maybe do~~~~~~~~
See if I should make the printing path a double-linked list, to eliminate recursion
	--or--
	Just take the risk by putting higher numbers first
Use HashMap for adding links
	--or--
	Find if should free linked list created before links
Thoroughly test everything
