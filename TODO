REMOVE THE sleep(1) IN GET_PATHS BEFORE PUSHING TO VOGSPHERE OR TESTING SPEED
	We'lll probably do it, but imagine if we didn't...
It works pretty well, as far as I know
	There's an issue where the paths keep growing after they've reached the start,
		or at least that's what I think is happening. I'll debug it later.
